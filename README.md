# N-body: The Barnes-Hut Algorithm with Quasi-Peroidic Boundary conditions

For more information regarding quasi-periodic boundary conditions with Barnes-Hut, we refer the reader to Bouchet & Hernquist 1988

Documentation regarding the free-parameters of the simulation can be seen in the notebook `example.ipynb`. 

## Running the Simulation 

The module can be run via command line via the following example: 

```simulation.py -L 3 -opening_angle 0.2 -softening 1e-2 -N 24 -rand_type 0 --store```
